        "content": "Today was so great, it was so fun, she was so sexy."
      },
      {
        "title": "You call yourself a feminist??",
        "content": "Among other things, I just find it ironic that they allude to this being some type of misogynistic or sexist thing but they are in fact being sexist by ranting against 'men' (not even the action itself) calling it 'manspreading', specifically attributing it to 'men' as if women can't act peculiar or rude (...maybe more so during certain times of the year ðŸ¤”  but oh I can't say that because, though 100% scientifically true, it's sexist but this somehow isn't ðŸ˜• ???? FYI this is the PC bs that got 'The Donald' elected). If a 'man' (or woman) happens to be rude they are simply a rude person don't attribute their behavior to their gender that is the very definition of sexism, they would see this if they get their head out of their a**. This is why it's so hard for me to take this mainstream 'feminism' seriously, they are not about equality they seem more about control and the destruction of everything 'masculine'. All in all, not every personal preference is meant to be publicly accommodated so everyone from time to time (men and women) has to tolerate actions and 'perceived' rudeness from others, so be woMAN about it and deal with it just as we men do."
